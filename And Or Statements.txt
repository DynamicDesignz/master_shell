and mixing and's and or's with certain rules will break them, because it pushes evaluation to end of body
like exestrip, needs to be all or's
same with maxsize
those have to trigger in-line
at the time of processing, not wait to the end of body to check a complex set of conditions
policy routes help you to make things more complex, but keep the rules themselves : their conditions simple
if your message triggers a policy route, and that policy route is restricted to a rule, that rule can fire on your message
if your message doesn't trigger a policy route, and that policy route is restricted to a rule, that rule CANT fire on your message (This is an exemption, like the tech laid out in the case)
if your message triggers a policy route, and that policy route is DISABLED for a rule, that rule CANT fire on your message
And if its disabed and restricted, it MUST match at least one policy route in the restricted list, and MUST NOT match ANY policy routes in the disabled list
at least one restricted, and none disabled
